# MyBudget
My Budget is a simple android app developed using Java. The main purpose of developing this app was for me to get a good understanding of how Android development works. The app functions as a budget tracker. User inputs their incomings and outgoings, their data is then inserted into a SQLite databse and the app then pulls relevant data from the database and displays their outgoings in a ListView populated by a custom ArrayAdapter and lets the user know how much they have left over.
